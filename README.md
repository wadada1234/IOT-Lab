# Internet of Things Lab:
All the Programs of the 7th Sem Internet of Things (IoT) Lab with their output in different steps. This lab provides students with hands-on experience in implementing and understanding core IoT concepts. It focuses on practical exposure to essential IoT topics such as sensor interfacing, microcontroller programming, communication protocols, data acquisition, cloud integration, IoT architecture, and real-time monitoring, enabling students to design, connect, and deploy IoT-based applications effectively.

## Introduction to RTU Internet of Things (IoT) Lab:
The Internet of Things (IoT) Lab, as prescribed by Rajasthan Technical University (RTU) for the 7th Semester, provides students with hands-on experience in designing, programming, and deploying IoT-based systems. The lab emphasizes the integration of hardware components, sensors, embedded programming, networking, cloud connectivity, and real-time data handling.
This lab bridges theoretical IoT concepts with practical implementation, enabling students to create intelligent, connected, and automated systems.

## Objectives:
-To familiarize students with IoT architecture, sensors, actuators, and embedded hardware.

-To develop skills in microcontroller programming using Arduino, NodeMCU/ESP32, or Raspberry Pi.

-To implement IoT communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, and WebSockets.

-To enable students to collect, process, and transmit sensor data to cloud platforms.

-To provide experience with IoT cloud services such as ThingSpeak, Firebase, AWS IoT, or Blynk.

-To help students design mini IoT applications integrating hardware + software + networking.

## Lab Structure and Experiments:
The lab generally includes 10–12 experiments covering:
-Sensor interfacing and ADC programming.

-Actuator control using microcontrollers.

-IoT communication (WiFi/Bluetooth/Zigbee).

-MQTT/HTTP cloud communication.

-Real-time sensor monitoring dashboards.

-Data logging and visualization.

-IoT security basics.

-Simple automation and IoT mini-projects.

Each experiment builds progressively from basic hardware interfacing to full IoT system implementation.

-Home automation.

-Smart agriculture.

-Environmental monitoring.

-Industrial IoT.

-Wearable devices.

-Cloud-connected applications.

## RTU Internet Of Things Lab Experiments:
**1.** IoT skills are essential for roles in smart city solutions, robotics, and embedded systems engineering. 1. StartRaspberry Pi and try various Linix commands in command terminal
 window: ls, cd, touch, mv, rm, man, mkdir, rmdir, tar, gzip, cat, more, less, ps, sudo, cron, chown, chgrp, ping etc.

 **2.** Run some python programs on Pi like:
 
 a) Read your name and print Hellomessage with name.
 
 b) Read two numbers and print their sum, difference, product and division.
 
 c) Word and character count of a given string.
 
 d) Area of a given shape (rectangle, triangle and circle) reading shape and appropriate values from standard input.
 
 **3.** Run some python programs on Pi like:
 
 a) Print a name 'n' times, where name and n are read from standard input, using for and while loops.
 
 b) Handle Divided by Zero Exception.
 
 c) Print current time for 10 times with an interval of 10 seconds.
 
 d) Read a file line by line andprint the word count of each line.
 
**4.** a) Light an LED through Python program.

 b) Get input from two switches and switch on corresponding LEDs.
 
 c) Flash an LED at a given on time and off time cycle, where the two times are taken from a file.
 
 **5.** a) Flash an LED based oncron output (acts as an alarm).
 
 b) Switch on a relay at a given time using cron, where the relay's contact terminals are connected to a load.
 
 c) Get the status of a bulb at a remote place (on the LAN) through web. The student should have hands on experience inusing various sensors like temperature, humidity, smoke, light, etc. and should be able to use control web camera, network, and relays connected to the Pi.
